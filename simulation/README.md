We used CAMPAREE and BEERS2 to simulate raw FASTQ files. For installation instructions, please refer to their official repositories: https://github.com/itmat/CAMPAREE/tree/main and https://github.com/itmat/BEERS2/tree/main. 

The files ENCFF000CXQ.camparee.config.yaml and ENCFF000CXQ.beers2.config.yaml are example configuration templates used in our simulations. Please ensure to update the directory paths accordingly before using them.
